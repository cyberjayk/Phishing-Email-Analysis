# Phishing-Email-Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this project was to perform a full phishing email investigation using real-world analyst methodologies. This included analyzing email headers, identifying malicious indicators of compromise (IOCs), decoding embedded payloads, conducting URL reputation checks, and producing a structured incident report.
This project replicates the workflow used by SOC analysts during email-based threat investigations.

### Skills Learned
Email header analysis (Return-Path, SPF, DKIM, DMARC, Received chain)
Identifying sender spoofing and display-name impersonation
Extracting and decoding base64-encoded email bodies
URL reputation analysis using URLScan.io and VirusTotal
Conducting reverse DNS lookups and WHOIS enrichment
Understanding phishing infrastructure and credential-harvesting patterns
Writing clear, actionable incident documentation and reporting

### Tools Used
Ubuntu Terminal (nslookup, whois)

Sublime Text for viewing .eml files with header colorization

CyberChef for decoding base64 and extracting embedded URLs

URLScan.io for reputation scanning and infrastructure analysis

VirusTotal for multi-engine URL analysis
